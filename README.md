## Selected Projects

### LLM from Scratch
Repository: https://github.com/11AbiRam11/LLM

Implemented a Transformer-based language model in PyTorch from first principles.

Key components:
- Custom tokenization pipeline
- Positional encoding
- Multi-head attention mechanism
- Feed-forward layers
- Causal masking for next-token prediction
- Custom training loop with gradient clipping and learning rate scheduling

This project strengthened my understanding of model architecture, training dynamics, and the end-to-end ML lifecycle.

### Automated Stock ETL System
Repository: https://github.com/11AbiRam11/ETL_Py-to-Sql

Built a fully automated data ingestion pipeline:

- Extracted financial data via API
- Standardized and validated datasets
- Loaded into SQL database
- Eliminated manual reporting through scheduled automation

Demonstrated strong data cleaning, validation, and workflow automation practices.
